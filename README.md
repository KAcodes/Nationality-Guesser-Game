## Project Description

I created an entertaining program which guesses a country code based on the first name which the user supplies. I built this to develop and display my use of asyncronous functions using a fetch API. The program also uses React Hooks to dynamically set answers based on user input. The Nationalise API was used to retrieve a name from a database, the API limit is 1000 requests per day, no sign up or key is required.

The ToDo list allows users to add or delete tasks, and uses the input bar to also update tasks. The tasks can also be marked as completed.
